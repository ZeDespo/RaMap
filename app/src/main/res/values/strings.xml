    <string name="McGinley_Center">"Built in 1959, the McGinley Center is Rose Hill's "living room,"
        where students socialize, attend events, and dine at the Marketplace and Dagger John's.
        Named in honor of Father Laurence J. McGinley, president of Fordham University from 1949 to 1963,
        the student center is also home to the Office of Career Services, the University Bookstore, Campus Ministry,
        and the Office of Student Leadership and Community Development. It also houses the Dorothy Day Center for Service
        and Justice, and Global Outreach, a cultural immersion and service program."</string>
